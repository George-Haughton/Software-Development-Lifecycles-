### Lifecycles

Waterfall development has specific goals for each phase of development. Each phase has to be completed before moving on to the next. At the end of each phase, a review is taken place to determine if the project is on the right path and whether we should continue or discard the whole thing. There are 6 phases of the Waterfall model and they are: requirements, which are where the potential requirements of the application are methodically analysed and written down in a specification document that serves as the basis for all future development. Secondly is, Analysis and during this phase the system is reviewed/analysed so we can properly generate the business logic and models that will be used later in the actual application. Next is the design phase this stage covers technical design requirements such as data layers, services and programming languages. Coding is next where all of the core coding is written implementing all models, business logic and service integrations that were specified in the prior stages. The next phase is the testing phase where beta testers and all other testers systematically discover and report any issues they find with the application. Lastly, is the Operations phase, the operations stage entails not just the deployment of the application, but also subsequent support and maintenance that may be required to keep it functional and up-to-date.   Some advantages of Waterfall are that it is very simple and easy to understand and use, phases do not overlap as each one is completed before moving onto the next, it is one of the best models to use for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood and finally it is easy to manage because of the rigidity of the model. A few disadvantages of the Waterfall model is it is not good for projects that are complex and object-oriented projects, it is a model that contains high amounts of risk and uncertainty, one the project/application is in testing stage it is very hard to go back and change something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage, it is not a good model for projects that are long and ongoing and lastly, there is no working software produced until one of the last phases within the life cycle.  

The main idea of a Prototype model is to create a throwaway prototype to understand the requirements of the project. The prototype is develop based on the requirements we know. By using this model, the developers can get a ‘feel’ of the system; since the interactions with prototype can enable the client to better understand the requirements of the desired system. The advantages of Prototyping are users remain actively involved in the development process, it has quicker user feedbacks than most models leading to better solutions and lastly, confusing or difficult functions can be easily identified. The disadvantages of Prototyping are: practically this methodology might increase the difficulty of the system; as the scope of the system may expand beyond original plans, incomplete or inadequate problem analysis and an incomplete application may cause the application no to be used as the fully system was designed. Some good examples of when you should use the Prototype model is when the desired system needs to have a lot of interaction with the ends users. Additionally, online system and web interfaces have a very high amount of interaction with end users and these are best suited for Prototype model. Lastly, Prototyping makes sure that the end users constantly work with the system to provide feedback which is incorporated in the prototype to result in a usable system. 

The Spiral model emphasises the importance of risk analysis. There are four main phases of The Spiral model which include: the planning phase things like Business Requirement Specifications and System Requirement specifications are gathered to make sure you know the ins and outs and what needs to be done/happen within a project. The risk analysis stage which for the Spiral model is one of the most important phases. Within this phase a process is done to identify certain risks you may occur during a project and alternate solutions you can take to avoid these risks or make them easier to deal with. Towards the end of the Risk Analysis phase a prototype will then be produced to help further with finding any bugs, problems and to see how the prototype looks/feels. Thirdly, we have the engineering phase which is where software is developed and a lot of testing is done within the software to make sure it properly works. Finally, is the evaluation phases where the customer will evaluate the output of the project to date before the project continues to the next spiral. There are a few advantages of using the Spiral Model; one being the high amount of risk analysis pays off greatly when it comes to the performance and the quality of the project, it is good for large and mission-critical projects, additional functionality can be added later in time, there is a strong approval and documentation control and lastly software is produced early in the software life cycle. With advantages come disadvantages, these being: it can be a very costly model to use, the high amount of risk analysis involved requires a highly specific expertise, not a good model for smaller projects and lastly the project’s success is highly dependent on how the risk analysis phase goes. A few examples of when you should use the Spiral Model, would be when cost and risk evaluation is important, for medium to high risk projects, when the user is unsure of the needs they want, when they requirements are complex and finally for a new product line.

Rapid application development (RAD) heavily emphasizes rapid prototyping and iterative delivery; because of this it is  good alternative to the Waterfall development model. There are alot of advantanges of RAD but these are just a few crucial ones you should take into consideration. Firstly, it is easy to measure progress as there are so many components, iterations, and prototpyes coming down the pipe, and so much information and feedback being given back everything can be maintained and evaluated to amke sure you are keeping schedules and budgets. A large percentage of active software developers will switch to the multi-discipline roles, a Rapid application development methodology allows skilled team members to quickly produce prototypes and code that works to illustrate examples that using a slower development technique could take weeks. While most models wait until the end to begin integrations, an application will be integrated pretty much instantly. While developing software is a fairly malleable form, since code can be alterd that can change the entire system. It is an advantage to the developers to use this flexibilty early on and use it alot; by iterating concepts or ideas while developing. On the other hand there are a few disadvantages of RAD, one being that eventhough RAD gives the developers alot of flexibility throughout the product's lifecycle; it reduces the control and restrictions which in reality is not all bad but on large projects it can be difficult. Finally, when using RAD the team will need to consist of a very skilled group of invididuals because the system and components evolve alot.
