### Lifecycles
Waterfall
Waterfall development has specific goals for each phase of development. Each phase has to be completed before moving on to the next. At the end of each phase, a review is taken place to determine if the project is on the right path and whether we should continue or discard the whole thing. There are 6 phases of the Waterfall model and they are: requirements, which are where the potential requirements of the application are methodically analysed and written down in a specification document that serves as the basis for all future development. Secondly is, Analysis and during this phase the system is reviewed/analysed so we can properly generate the business logic and models that will be used later in the actual application. Next is the design phase this stage covers technical design requirements such as data layers, services and programming languages. Coding is next where all of the core coding is written implementing all models, business logic and service integrations that were specified in the prior stages. The next phase is the testing phase where beta testers and all other testers systematically discover and report any issues they find with the application. Lastly, is the Operations phase, the operations stage entails not just the deployment of the application, but also subsequent support and maintenance that may be required to keep it functional and up-to-date.   Some advantages of Waterfall are that it is very simple and easy to understand and use, phases do not overlap as each one is completed before moving onto the next, it is one of the best models to use for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood and finally it is easy to manage because of the rigidity of the model. A few disadvantages of the Waterfall model is it is not good for projects that are complex and object-oriented projects, it is a model that contains high amounts of risk and uncertainty, one the project/application is in testing stage it is very hard to go back and change something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage, it is not a good model for projects that are long and ongoing and lastly, there is no working software produced until one of the last phases within the life cycle.
