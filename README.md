## Software-Development-Lifecycles

### 1. Lifecycles


#### 1.1 Waterfall
Waterfall development has specific goals for each phase of development. Each phase has to be completed before moving on to the next. At the end of each phase, a review is taken place to determine if the project is on the right path and whether we should continue or discard the whole thing. There are 6 phases of the Waterfall model and they are: requirements, which are where the potential requirements of the application are methodically analysed and written down in a specification document that serves as the basis for all future development. Secondly is, Analysis and during this phase the system is reviewed/analysed so we can properly generate the business logic and models that will be used later in the actual application. Next is the design phase this stage covers technical design requirements such as data layers, services and programming languages. Coding is next where all of the core coding is written implementing all models, business logic and service integrations that were specified in the prior stages. The next phase is the testing phase where beta testers and all other testers systematically discover and report any issues they find with the application. Lastly, is the Operations phase, the operations stage entails not just the deployment of the application, but also subsequent support and maintenance that may be required to keep it functional and up-to-date.

##### Advantages 
Some advantages of Waterfall are that it is very simple and easy to understand and use, phases do not overlap as each one is completed before moving onto the next, it is one of the best models to use for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood and finally it is easy to manage because of the rigidity of the model. 

##### Disadvantages
A few disadvantages of the Waterfall model are it is not good for projects that are complex and object-oriented projects, it is a model that contains high amounts of risk and uncertainty, one the project/application is in testing stage it is very hard to go back and change something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage, it is not a good model for projects that are long and ongoing and there is no working software produced until one of the last phases within the life cycle. A good time to use the Waterfall lifecycle is when all of the requirements are well known, clear and there are no ambiguous requirements. 

A good time to use this model is when the product definition is stable. Finally, the perfect project to use this lifecycle in is a small/short project.

#### 1.2 Prototype
The main idea of a Prototype model is to create a throwaway prototype to understand the requirements of the project. The prototype is develop based on the requirements we know. By using this model, the developers can get a ‘feel’ of the system; since the interactions with prototype can enable the client to better understand the requirements of the desired system. 

##### Advantages 
The advantages of Prototyping are users remain actively involved in the development process, it has quicker user feedbacks than most models leading to better solutions and lastly, confusing or difficult functions can be easily identified. 

##### Disadvantages
The disadvantages of Prototyping are: practically this methodology might increase the difficulty of the system; as the scope of the system may expand beyond original plans, incomplete or inadequate problem analysis and an incomplete application may cause the application no to be used as the fully system was designed. Some good examples of when you should use the Prototype model is when the desired system needs to have a lot of interaction with the ends users. Additionally, online system and web interfaces have a very high amount of interaction with end users and these are best suited for Prototype model. Lastly, Prototyping makes sure that the end users constantly work with the system to provide feedback which is incorporated in the prototype to result in a usable system. 

A couple projects that would benefit and give the best result when using the prototype model, would be when the desired system of the project needs to have a lot of interaction with the end users. Normally web interfaces and online systems both have a lot of user interaction so these types of projects would benefit using the prototype model.

#### 1.3 Spiral
The Spiral model emphasises the importance of risk analysis. There are four main phases of The Spiral model which include: the planning phase things like Business Requirement Specifications and System Requirement specifications are gathered to make sure you know the ins and outs and what needs to be done/happen within a project. The risk analysis stage which for the Spiral model is one of the most important phases. Within this phase a process is done to identify certain risks you may occur during a project and alternate solutions you can take to avoid these risks or make them easier to deal with. Towards the end of the Risk Analysis phase a prototype will then be produced to help further with finding any bugs, problems and to see how the prototype looks/feels. Thirdly, we have the engineering phase which is where software is developed and a lot of testing is done within the software to make sure it properly works. Finally, is the evaluation phases where the customer will evaluate the output of the project to date before the project continues to the next spiral. 

##### Advantages
There are a few advantages of using the Spiral Model; one being the high amount of risk analysis pays off greatly when it comes to the performance and the quality of the project, it is good for large and mission-critical projects, additional functionality can be added later in time, there is a strong approval and documentation control and lastly software is produced early in the software life cycle. 

##### Disadvantages
With advantages come disadvantages, these being: it can be a very costly model to use, the high amount of risk analysis involved requires a highly specific expertise, not a good model for smaller projects and lastly the project’s success is highly dependent on how the risk analysis phase goes. 

A few examples of when you should use the Spiral Model, would be when cost and risk evaluation is important within a project, for medium to high risk projects, when the user is unsure of the needs they want for their project, when their requirements are complex and finally for a new product line.

#### 1.4 V Model
In essence the V-model is about verification and validation.  It is an execution of processes all on a sequential path, very similar to the waterfall model. Additionally, each stage must be completed before moving onto the next and when it comes to the testing within the project it is done in parallel with a corresponding phase of development. The various phases of the V-model are as followed: firstly, we have the requirements phase which is where the requirements are gathered for the project and a system test will be created; this test plan will focus on meeting the functionality specified in the requirements gathering. Secondly, we have the HLD (high-level design) phase which will provide an overview of the project aspects such as: solution, platform, system, product and service/process also the HLD phase focuses on system design and its architecture. Lastly, with the HLD phase to test the software’s ability to work together an integration test is created. Next we have the LLD (low-level design) phase this phase will define the logic of each and every component of the system, things like the class diagram, the methods and its relation between classes with also come under the LLC phase. More importantly the software components are designed. The next stage is arguably the most important phase out of them all, as it contains the key and core parts of the project, the coding. This is called the implementation stage this stage is very similar to the next stage which is called coding. The implementation stage is where most of the coding takes place and once everyone is happy and the coding is finished the project will move further up the model which is where the test plans that were made earlier are used. Although, most of the coding starts within the implementation stage the last stage is named Coding and within this stage the module design will be converted into code by the developers within the team. Additionally, the unit testing of the project is done by the developers on the code they have written. 

##### Advantages
A few advantages of the V-model are it is: easy to use and not hard to get to grips with, a lot of time is saved because test designing and testing activities like planning are done way before coding; this is also why the V-model is more favoured and has a higher success rate than the waterfall model. 

##### Disadvantages
On the other hand, a few disadvantages would be it can be a rigid and at times can be seen as one of the least flexible models. Also the software is developed during the implementation stage so no prototypes are made, which means problems and issues can be overlooked. Lastly with the disadvantages if any changes are made during the middle of the model, then all of the test documents and the requirement documents have to be updated and changed. 

Lastly, with the V-model it should be used for projects such as small to medium ones, where the requirements are clearly understood/defined and where there is little to no change available for the requiremnets.

### 2. How is risk managed within the Spiral model?
The Spiral model is based a lot upon risk analysis and making sure every risk is taken into account when moving forward. The progress of the project depends a lot on the risk analysis phase and all ideas are risk analysed to see if it is beneficial to the project's progress. Within the Spiral model, risk is managed by firstly identifying the risk. Then making sure you know go through this risk in immense detail: for example, the consequences that come with the risk and the complications of the risk. Then finally, finding a way to decrease this risk or dismiss it altogether. A process is undertaken to identify risks and other solutions that can be used to prevent/lower the chance of failure and risks. A prototype produced at the end of the risk analysis phase to help see what the finished product would look like after all of the points from the risk analysis have been taken into account. If a risk or problem is found during the risk analysis there will be a brainstorm of solutions and ideas that could either help reduce this risk or completely eliminate it. The Spiral model emphasises the importance of risk analysis. There are four main phases of The Spiral model which include: the planning phase things like Business Requirement Specifications and System Requirement specifications are gathered to make sure you know the ins and outs and what needs to be done/happen within a project. The risk analysis stage which for the Spiral model is one of the most important phases. Within this phase a process is done to identify certain risks you may occur during a project and alternate solutions you can take to avoid these risks or make them easier to deal with. Towards the end of the Risk Analysis phase a prototype will then be produced to help further with finding any bugs, problems and to see how the prototype looks/feels. Thirdly, we have the engineering phase which is where software is developed and a lot of testing is done within the software to make sure it properly works. Finally, is the evaluation phases where the customer will evaluate the output of the project to date before the project continues to the next spiral. There are a few advantages of using the Spiral Model; one being the high amount of risk analysis pays off greatly when it comes to the performance and the quality of the project, it is good for large and mission-critical projects, additional functionality can be added later in time, there is a strong approval and documentation control and lastly software is produced early in the software life cycle.

A few examples of when you should use the Spiral Model, would be when cost and risk evaluation is important within a project, for medium to high risk projects, when the user is unsure of the needs they want for their project, when their requirements are complex and finally for a new product line.

### 3. The purpose of a feasibility report
A feasibility report, is an analysis of the viability of a project. Additionally, it accesses of the strengths and weaknesses of an idea and will examine the proposal in detail to see if it is worthwhile and practical to go forward with. It is taken very seriously and is an initial part of any new project. It is a process of thinking of the logical start and the logical end of the idea in immense detail. The purpose of a feasibility report is to know the different variables involved with taking your project or business venture onto the business market and if/how it will be accepted by the public; and who the target audience will consist of; and finally, if the project as a whole is feasible. A feasibility report is important for a business as it helps them identify nearly all business-related problems and also helps identify logistical problems; and a feasibility report can provide the business with the solutions to mitigate these problems. Finally, the importance of a feasibility report is the fact it can help convince investors or banks that investing in your business is a good idea. There are a several components within a feasibility report firstly, we have the description, which contains a layout of the business for example the products or services it provides and then how they are delivered. Secondly, we have a market feasibility, which describes the industry, it goes through the future potential of the market and the current potential. A Technical feasibility will lay out the important details about how the service/good is provided/delivered. A few of these details would be materials, labour, technology needed, transportation and business location. Arguably the most important component is a Financial feasibility as it contains a projection of the initial start-up costs needed, what sources of capital are available and which ones will be used, and also what returns can be expected on the investment. The final component is the Organizational feasibility this will outline the definition of the legal and corporate structure of the business, this might contain information about the founders of the business, what kind of professional background, the skills they have that may be necessary to get the company of the ground. Lastly, when thinking about how feasbile a project is, you will need to go over the functional and non-functional requirements as when going about creating a feasbility report you need to look at everything about this project to see if your business is going to work well with it and this can stem off what kind of requirements the project needs.

### 4. Technical Solutions
A technical solution is when an individual will come in to help with a project for a number of reasons. Their main job is to design, develop and implement a solution to a certain requirement or problem that has occurred within a project. For example, within a project there may be a problem within the code that you can’t seem to get your head around, this is the time you would ask another member of your team or bring in external help to come up with a technical solution.

Technical solutions can be compared in a number of ways. Firstly, they can be compared by the time it takes to implement this solution the faster a problem can be fixed the better for the project as a whole but this depends on the severity of the problem. If the job is a complicated problem, it’s going to take a lot longer than a problem that can be fixed without a huge amount of thinking. Secondly, we can compare technical solutions on how difficult they are. This can be how challenging the solution may be to implement or put into action. For example, will the solution be easy like editing a few lines of code or difficult like altering a huge part of the code altogether. Thirdly, we can compare technical solutions on the skills needed to implement them. What skills are needed to solve this problem, is it a simple problem that someone within the team can fix or is at a difficult problem where a lot of skills are going to be needed; and who is the right person that should be chosen for this task. Similarly, to the other ways we can compare technical solutions it all depends on what kind of problem it is. The team may be able to use the skills of someone on the team or they might need to bring someone with a different set of skills from outside the team to come up with a solution; which we can trace back to what skills are needed to solve this problem. Next we can compare Technical soltuions on how much they cost.

### 5. Software investigation to meet a business need.
Our first meeting with our client was the 2nd of October 2017, this is where ZSL (London zoo) went through what requirements they would like within their proposition. Their business need was for us to design and develop a game/app that they would use to help with teaching and keeping the children more engaged. They did not have a game/app that they felt supported them enough while they were teaching their lessons and this is why they wanted us to develop a game/app they could use to help them teach their lesson and keep the children more engaged and interested. The game would be based around 4 different greenhouse gas product chains: Plastic bottles, Mobile phones, Beef, and Electronics being left on standby such as TVs. The first time they will be using the game will be the 14th of November; and we will have regular meetings with them to discuss our progress and any changes they would like to make to our progress. In our first meeting they gave us a presentation about what they would like and when they would like it. On the 17th of October we visited Whipsnade zoo to present our concept ideas we had designed for the app/game. We created a PowerPoint that fully explained what we intended to make, with features, main menu concept art and in-game screen concept art. After we had presented our concept ideas, ZSL gave us little talk on things they would change and things they would add such as changing how the main game screen looked from a maze to be focused more on the chain itself. We wrote down all of the feedback we got from ZSL and would then go on to implement it into our work.

We wrote down all of the adapting feedback we got which included what ZSL would like us to change. An example of a change they wanted was a change to the main game screen. Our idea was a maze where the player/child would control a small animal relating to the habitat and would manoeuvre around the maze and try to escape. Our client (ZSL) liked the idea but preferred if we focused the gameplay on the chain more. So we implemented their ideas into ours and changed completely how our main game screen looked:

Here is the difference after speaking to ZSL:
Before:

After:

We decided that the original concept art we had looked too cartoony and unprofessional and the client agreed and ask if we could change it. After brainstorming a few ideas, we came up with the idea to focus more on the chain and added the idea of the player/child having to drag the correct step in the chain to its correct place within the chain at the top of the screen; the game already gave the player/child the first and last step to help them complete it.

Additionally, we made a Gantt chart to help us meet these needs. The Gantt chart helped us identify the needs that ZSL had and how we were going to address them and when we anticipated/hoped we would complete these needs and requirements. We met these needs as a team and all were very confident with the outcome.

### 6. Software Tools and Techniques 
We used many tools and techniques to help us achieve the requirements that ZSL had set for us. If they were software tools or in person techniques to help us communicate with ZSL. For example, we used tools such as Photoshop and image editor to build our assists such as our images that we used for each of the habitat backgrounds, we used Power Point to create a guide that guided ZSL through our ideas ranging from the base idea of the game, concept art, menu screens, and how the game plays out and finally, we used Word Document to document our progress, write down the requirements of the project and create our sprint back logs. Finally, we Edexcel to create our Gantt Chart that helped guide us through when we should be working on a certain criteria and when a certain requirement should be completed. The techniques we used are based on our research and how we communicated with our client to get the information we needed. These techniques consisted of interviews where ZSL gave us a presentation of what they wanted and how they wanted it to look, we took in this information and asked them questions on things we either didn’t understand or things we wanted more information on. We also used prototyping with our game. We made a prototype of our game to show ZSL what our concept ideas would look like for real and how our game would play out after it was finished. For the research part of the project we used techniques such as secondary research where we would google search things like: 'what kind of games do children from the age of 11-16 play?' as that is the age range that ZSL will be teaching the game at, play; this would give us a better idea at what play style would better suit this project. Additionally, we researched other games to help us paint a picture of what type of concept art to use for our game, for example what kind of pictures and themes 11-16 year olds prefer, enjoy playing and engage more with. Lastly, we used primary research that was in the form of a questionnaire that we asked 11-16 year olds to help us better understand what kind of game style and themes they liked.
